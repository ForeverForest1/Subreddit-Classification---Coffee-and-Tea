       "automatic pour over machines so i went to verve today and got a pour over  i wanted to try their new single origin costa rican and i noticed they  along with many other larger roasters  have switched over to a completely machine processed pour over  while i understand the reasons for transitioning to this method  for me it lost a little of the nostalgia i get when visiting local cafes  i love watching the barista prepare the carafe and kettle  analyzing their technique  and even asking them questions on occasion  and i swear it didn’t taste as good as when someone manually does it themselves  does anyone else feel this way                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            False\n",
